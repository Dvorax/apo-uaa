        </div>

        <p class="lead">
          Check out our club at any of our events during Rush Week! Membership is open to both male and female students at UAA. You can also <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> electronically or in person to say that you are interested and we can get you set up to be a pledge for our next pledging period. In order to become a member, you must complete the pledging program.

            <h2 id="rush">Rush Week</h2>
            <p>This is a chance for students on campus to check out our club! We are having a number of public events to give you a taste of what membership is like. Come to have fun, meet people, take part in the activities, and ask questions. We will extend a friendly invitation to attendees to participate in our pledging program.</p>

            <h2 id="pledging">Pledging</h2>
            <p>This is a 6-8 week long program designed to prepare you to become an active member of the fraternity. It begins with the Pledge Ceremony and is driven by weekly meeting where you will be learning about APO and doing a course-long project as a group. The meeting will be scheduled to accomodate as many pledges as possible. At the end, we will have an Activation Ceremony for the pledge class to signify their transition into full members.</p>

            <h2 id="membership">Active Membership</h2>
            <p>Active members are expected to attend the weekly chapter meeting and encouraged to attend all of our service and fellowship events. Class or work schedules may prevent you from attending meetings and many events, sometimes for whole semesters -- we understand -- full participation is not required, but some involvement in club activities is needed to retain your active membership.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="span8">
            <strong>Why should I join?</strong>
            <p>Joining our chapter in Alpha Phi Omega has many benefits which we will outline using our three cardinal principals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Develop leadership skills:</em>
                <p>There are many opportunities for members to develop their leadership skills, which have lots of practical uses outside of the club. There are always upcoming events and activities that need to be managed, officer positions in the club that come with some responsibility, and formal leadership training from APO.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Foster friendships:</em>
                <p>Joining a club like ours give you a new circle of people to make friends with. Club activities give a sense of brotherhood that bonds us together. There are also frequent fellowship events where we have fun as a group.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Provide service to humanity:</em>
                <p>We are a service fraternity and our goal is to provide service to the fraternity, to our campus, to the community, and to the nation. We plan lots of events where we can help out in the community and those are also fun and very rewarding.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="span2">
            <strong>Is there any hazing involved?</strong>
            <p>No, the national organization of Alpha Phi Omega does not tolerate hazing or informal initiation and we will not be doing it in our chapter. It is also prohibited by UAA and illegal in many states, though not in Alaska.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="span2">
            <strong>Aren't fraternities just for guys?</strong>
            <p>No, our fraternity is coed, so women are also welcome as "Brothers" since we consider it a gender-neutral term. Women have been allowed as full members of the fraternity since the 1976 National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
